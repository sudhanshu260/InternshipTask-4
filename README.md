# InternshipTask-4
learned how to summarize data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and MAX, and how to categorize results using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. I also added a new marks column to analyze student performance.


During this task, I learned:

* How to use aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), and MIN() to summarize numeric data.
* The use of the GROUP BY clause to categorize data based on a specific column (e.g., grade or age).
*  The difference between WHERE and HAVING:
       WHERE filters rows before grouping,
       HAVING filters groups after aggregation.
*  How to filter and analyze grouped data using HAVING with aggregate results.
*  How to find DISTINCT values in a column.
*  How to modify an existing table (ALTER TABLE) and update data (UPDATE) for real-world reporting
